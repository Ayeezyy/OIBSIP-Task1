# Iris Flower Classification Project

## Overview
This project is a machine learning model for classifying iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The model is trained on the famous Iris dataset and implemented using Python and popular machine learning libraries.

## Features
- Utilizes the Iris dataset for training and testing .
- Provides accuracy metrics and evaluation results for model performance.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

## Results
The project achieves 100% accuracy on the test dataset using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model, demonstrating highly effective classification of iris flower species.
